This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named blinkit analysis with python.ipynb, focused on conducting an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Blinkit’s sales data. Blinkit is a quick commerce grocery delivery platform in India.

Technologies & Libraries:

1) Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and numerical analysis
2) Matplotlib (and potentially Seaborn): For generating charts and visual representations of trends
3) Jupyter Notebook: To structure the EDA process in readable, interactive cells

This aligns with industry-standard tools found in similar Blinkit analysis projects.

Workflow & Key Steps:

1) Import & Clean Data
     Load datasets (likely CSV/Excel)
     Manage missing values and standardize categorical fields (e.g., Low Fat vs Regular Fat)
2) Exploratory Analysis
      Breakdown of sales distribution by product type, fat content, outlet size, and location tier
      Identify sales trends, peak months, and outlet establishment patterns
      Compute core business KPIs like:
           a) Total & average sales
           b) Item counts
           c) Average customer rating
   
Similar processes are noted in other Blinkit EDA workflows:

3) Visualization
      Generate pie charts, bar graphs, and line plots to highlight:
             Sales by fat content (“Low Fat” vs “Regular”)
             Category-wise performance (fruits & vegetables, snacks, etc.)
             Outlet trends (by tier, size, and year established)
             Visual styles mirror what’s demonstrated in existing PowerBI dashboards and notebooks l
   
Insights & Business Value
Although the notebook itself doesn’t publish final conclusions, typical findings include:

1) Fat content effect: Quantify how low-fat items stack against regular variants in revenue
2) Category trends: Determine which categories dominate Blinkit’s sales volume
3) Outlet insights: Discover outperforming outlet tiers (e.g., Tier 3) or sizes (e.g., medium outlets)
4) Temporal trends: Identify strong performance years or seasonal peaks
   
These insights are instrumental for inventory planning, marketing focus, and outlet growth strategies.
